## 🚀 Initial Release v1.1.0

Welcome to the first public release of Hyperfy Tools, your advanced physics and collider creation system for Blender. This release introduces the core functionality needed to create optimized physics objects for the Hyperfy engine.

### ✨ Core Features

#### Physics System
- Complete rigidbody creation system
- Three physics types: Static, Dynamic, and Kinematic
- Advanced mass property controls
- Automated hierarchy generation

#### Collider Framework
- Four collider types: Box, Sphere, Geometry, and Simple
- Smart mesh optimization for Simple colliders
- Convex/Concave collision modes
- Trigger volume support

#### Export System
- GLB export with property preservation
- Batch export capabilities
- Auto-centering functionality
- Hierarchy maintenance

### 🛠️ Technical Updates

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient collider generation
- Optimized mesh decimation for Simple colliders
- Smart property handling

#### Quality of Life
- Intuitive UI in Blender's 3D View
- Quick-access sidebar panel
- Batch operations support
- Clear visual feedback

### 🎮 Usage Notes

#### Recommended Workflows
- Use Simple colliders for most dynamic objects
- Box/Sphere colliders for basic shapes
- Geometry colliders for complex static meshes

#### Best Practices
- Keep collision meshes as simple as possible
- Use convex colliders for dynamic-dynamic interactions
- Utilize batch operations for multiple objects

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Extremely high-poly meshes may cause slower performance in Simple collider generation
- Batch export may require additional memory for large scenes
- Some complex hierarchies may need manual adjustment

### 📋 Requirements

- Blender 4.3.0 or higher
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended
- GPU with OpenGL 4.5+ support

### 🎯 Future Plans

- Enhanced mesh optimization algorithms
- Additional collider types
- Advanced physics property controls
- Expanded batch operations
- Custom property editor
